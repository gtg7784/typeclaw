description: Use this skill BEFORE every `channel_reply` or `channel_send` call whose adapter is `github`, AND before composing replies to GitHub-originated inbounds. GitHub renders **real markdown** — `**bold**`, `## headings`, `| tables |`, fenced code blocks, and `inline code` all render natively. Use rich markdown freely. GitHub cannot send file attachments via API — do not call `channel_send` with attachments on github chats. GitHub has no typing indicator. PR review threads use `thread` keyed on the root comment id; reply to a thread to stay in it, or omit `thread` to post a top-level issue/PR comment. Read this skill before composing anything on GitHub.

GitHub renders normal Markdown in issues, PRs, discussions, and review comments. Use headings, lists, tables, fenced code blocks, links, and inline code when they improve clarity.

- Do not send attachments on GitHub chats; the adapter rejects them.
- There is no typing indicator.
- For PR review threads, keep `thread` set to reply in-place. Omit `thread` for a top-level PR/issue comment.
