  //            operator's control loop (channel readers, remote git host).
  //            NO role auto-bypasses; ack required from every role.
  //   medium — bypass produces silent attacker-favorable state in model
  //            context (env dump, .env contents, IAM creds, secret-shaped
  //            session-search hits). Owner bypasses, trusted does not.
  //   low    — bypass produces a noisy, immediately-recoverable side
  //            effect. Owner and trusted bypass. No inhabitants today.
  // Per-guard permissions above continue to work as explicit grants —
  // `tool.before` accepts EITHER the tier OR the per-guard string (OR
  // check). This lets operators knowingly re-open a single high-tier
  // guard for one role without widening the whole tier.
