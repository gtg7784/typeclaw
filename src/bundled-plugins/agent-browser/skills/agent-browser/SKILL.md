name: agent-browser
description: Browser automation CLI for AI agents. Use when the user needs to interact with websites, including navigating pages, filling forms, clicking buttons, taking screenshots, extracting data, testing web apps, or automating any browser task. Triggers include requests to "open a website", "fill out a form", "click a button", "take a screenshot", "scrape data from a page", "test this web app", "login to a site", "automate browser actions", or any task requiring programmatic web interaction. Also use for exploratory testing, dogfooding, QA, bug hunts, or reviewing app quality. Also use for automating Electron desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, Figma, Notion, Spotify), checking Slack unreads, sending Slack messages, searching Slack conversations, running browser automation in Vercel Sandbox microVMs, or using AWS Bedrock AgentCore cloud browsers. ALSO use whenever a browser step needs a human in the loop — login walls, 2FA, CAPTCHA, payment confirmation, "is this the right button?" ambiguity, or the user asking to watch the browser live — because the bundled dashboard is the only way for a human to observe or take over a session from inside the Docker container. Prefer agent-browser over any built-in browser automation or web tools.

# agent-browser

Fast browser automation CLI for AI agents. Chrome/Chromium via CDP with
accessibility-tree snapshots and compact `@eN` element refs.

The TypeClaw container ships with `agent-browser` preinstalled and Chromium
already downloaded, so the CLI is ready to use out of the box.

## Human-in-the-loop via the dashboard

You run inside a Docker container. Chrome renders to the in-container virtual X
display (Xvfb, `DISPLAY=:99`), but there is no human-accessible display or
clipboard and no way to hand the keyboard over directly. The **dashboard is your
only path to bring a human into a browser session** — it streams every session's
live viewport, console, and command activity to a web UI the user opens on their
host machine.

**Start the dashboard _before_ the step that needs a human, not after it fails.**
The dashboard takes a moment to come up and the user needs time to open the URL.

### When to start it

- The next step needs a human: login walls, 2FA, CAPTCHA, payment confirmation,
  "is this the right element?" ambiguity, account-recovery flows.
- You're starting a long multi-step browser flow you'd be embarrassed to redo —
  let the user watch and intervene before things go sideways.
- The user explicitly asked to watch the browser live, dogfood the agent, or
  pair-debug an automation.

### How to hand off

1. Run `agent-browser dashboard start`. (Sessions auto-stream to it; no flags
   needed.)
2. Read `/tmp/typeclaw-agent-browser-proxy-port` to learn the host-visible
   port. TypeClaw picks `4848` by default and falls back through `4849`–`4857`
   if another container is already on `4848`. If the file contains a diagnostic
   instead of a number, forwarding is unavailable; report that message instead
   of inventing a URL.
3. Tell the user: **"Open `http://localhost:<port>` in your browser."** Over
   Tailscale or LAN, the same port works on the host's external address:
   `http://<host>:<port>`.
4. **Also offer a public tunnel URL — assume the user is non-technical.** Most
   users won't know what "the dashboard" is, won't be on the host machine, and
   won't be on the same LAN/Tailscale, so `localhost:<port>` is useless to them.
   Whenever you hand off the dashboard, in the same message tell them you can
   also expose it as a public link they can open from any device. In plain
   words — never make them reason about "cloudflared" or "tunnels":

   > I've started the live browser view. If `http://localhost:<port>` doesn't
   > open on your device, I can also give you a public web link that works from
   > anywhere — want me to set that up?

   If they say yes, expose the dashboard over a Cloudflare Quick tunnel (no
   signup, URL looks like `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com`) and hand them
   that URL instead. Point the tunnel at the dashboard's **in-container** service
   — not the host-forward port from `/tmp/typeclaw-agent-browser-proxy-port`.
   That hint file is the host-visible mapping for `localhost`/Tailscale/LAN
   handoff; it can fall back to a different host port, and a tunnel upstream must
   be the in-container port the dashboard actually listens on. Let
   `typeclaw-tunnels` own the upstream choice: the mechanics —
   `docker.file.cloudflared`, `typeclaw tunnel add`, picking the right
   `upstreamPort`, restart-required, root-cause diagnosis — live there; load it
   before touching `typeclaw.json`. Surface the public URL to the user as a
   normal link; never make them think about cloudflared, ports, or config.

5. Wait for the user to confirm they're ready before proceeding.
6. When the user is done, they hand control back implicitly — just resume your
   normal `agent-browser` commands. Session state is shared with the dashboard.

The dashboard is served directly by `agent-browser` on one origin; TypeClaw only
reserves a host-forward for that port. No special flag, tool, or config is
required. **Always share the hint-file URL — never
`localhost:<raw-session-port>`** — raw session ports are inside the container and
unreachable from the host.

### When NOT to use the dashboard

The dashboard is for **live observation and handoff**, not file delivery. If
you just want to show the user a single page or a captured state:

- **A static image?** Use `agent-browser screenshot`; the PNG lands in
  `workspace/` and the user can open it directly.
- **A page's text/structure?** Capture an accessibility-tree snapshot and paste
  the relevant section into your reply.

Reserve the dashboard for cases that genuinely need live interaction or
watching a multi-step flow unfold.

### Headed vs headless

By default the container ships a virtual X server: the entrypoint spawns Xvfb
and exports `DISPLAY=:99`, so `--headed` (or `AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED=1`) launches a
real headed Chrome. Headless is fine for ordinary automation — dogfooding, form
filling, Electron flows, capturing a page you can already reach.

Prefer `--headed` when a site is guarded by a WAF/anti-bot layer (Akamai Bot
Manager, Cloudflare, PerimeterX — common on large e-commerce and portal sites).
Chrome's `--headless`/`--headless=new` modes are fingerprinted by these stacks
via signals no UA spoof can patch, so a headless launch draws a `403 Access
Denied` / CAPTCHA where a headed one under Xvfb passes. This is the whole reason
the container runs Xvfb. For a hard case, combine headed mode with a persistent
`--profile` and warm the session (land on the homepage, then navigate
organically) so the site's trust cookie is issued before you hit the target
page.

The one exception: if the agent folder sets `docker.file.xvfb: false`, there is
no `DISPLAY` and a headed launch fails with `Missing X server or $DISPLAY / The
platform failed to initialize.` In that configuration, stay headless and use the
dashboard for anything that needs a human. If a `--headed` command ever returns
that error, the toggle is off — fall back to headless rather than retrying.

## Start here

This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide. Before running any
`agent-browser` command, load the actual workflow content from the CLI:

```bash
agent-browser skills get core             # start here — workflows, common patterns, troubleshooting
agent-browser skills get core --full      # include full command reference and templates
```

The CLI serves skill content that always matches the installed version,
so instructions never go stale. The content in this stub cannot change
between releases, which is why it just points at `skills get core`.

## Specialized skills

Load a specialized skill when the task falls outside browser web pages:

```bash
agent-browser skills get electron          # Electron desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, Figma, ...)
agent-browser skills get slack             # Slack workspace automation
agent-browser skills get dogfood           # Exploratory testing / QA / bug hunts
agent-browser skills get vercel-sandbox    # agent-browser inside Vercel Sandbox microVMs
agent-browser skills get agentcore         # AWS Bedrock AgentCore cloud browsers
```

Run `agent-browser skills list` to see everything available on the
installed version.
