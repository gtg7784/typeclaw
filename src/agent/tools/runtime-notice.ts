// Wraps a runtime-emitted notice body in canonical SYSTEM MESSAGE framing so
// persona-rich models cannot read the prose as a chat instruction from a
// human and respond to it in-character.
//
// The failure mode this exists to prevent: tool results reach the model as
// USER-role messages (provider tool-call contract — engines cannot tag them
// as system). The `TOOL_RESULT_PREFIX` already marks each result's leading
// position, but trailing natural-language hints (the consecutive-send nudge
// is the canonical case) still parse as conversational prose, and Kimi-K2.x
// has been observed in production responding to those hints in-character —
// an apology directly addressed at the human ("sorry for talking so much,
// I'll be quieter next time") when the only stimulus in the prompt was the
// router's "Nth consecutive message; end your turn now" hint. Four
// consecutive in-character replies to fenced-prose runtime hints in a
// single drain iteration is the observed shape.
//
// Framing convention is the same shape `composeTurnPrompt` uses for the
// loop-guard block in `router.ts` — bracketed marker, fence rules, and
// explicit "Do not acknowledge or reply to this notice" closer. The
// loop-guard block has been in production against Kimi for months without
// the misread we observed on the consecutive-send hint, which is why we
// reuse the exact same shape here.
//
// Applied unconditionally (not model-gated): the cost is ~40 tokens per
// hint emission, paid only on consecutive sends (where the hint is already
// firing), and the framing is safe for every model — well-behaved models
// read it and move on. Gating by model family would have required a
// traits table for one defense and would still need extending the moment
// a second model family exhibited the same misread, so we accept the
// universal cost in exchange for never having to remember to add a new
// family to a list.

// The echoed sent text is load-bearing (the bot has no other view of what it
// just said — the inbound path drops self-authored messages — so without it a
// split reply re-sends near-duplicates). But that text is the model's OWN
// words, which is uniquely seductive to "reply" to: a persona-rich model
// (Kimi K2 on the GitHub channel, PR #481) read its own delivered prose as a
// fresh user turn and answered it ("you're welcome!", "aww thanks!") until the
// per-turn send cap. The weak `[system: tool result...]` prefix did not stop
// the misread; the full fence — bracketed marker, horizontal-rule fences,
// explicit "Do not reply" closer — has months of production track record
// against Kimi (it already wraps the consecutive-send and thread-mismatch
// hints). Reusing the exact same shape extends that protection to the echo.
