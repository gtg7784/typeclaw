// Builds a canonical match-rule DSL string from an inbound channel origin,
// for the role table. Output shape is always platform-wide + author:
//
//   slack:* author:<authorId>
//   discord:* author:<authorId>
//   telegram:* author:<authorId>
//   kakao:* author:<authorId>
//
// "Platform-wide" means every chat the adapter sees on that platform —
// DMs, group chats, and threads alike — gated by the author qualifier so
// only this specific human is matched. The intent is: once an operator
// proves they control a channel identity (by sending a code to the bot),
// they keep their role wherever they speak from on the same platform. To
// scope tighter (e.g. one workspace, one chat), the operator edits
// typeclaw.json by hand; the claim flow is deliberately broad because
// re-claiming on every new chat would be tedious for the common case.
