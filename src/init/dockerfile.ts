// On Debian trixie the single `iptables` package ships both the IPv4 nft

// "Unable to locate package". The shim invokes `iptables` and `ip6tables`
// which alternatives resolves to the nft variants.
//
// `util-linux` carries `setpriv`, which the shim uses to drop CAP_NET_ADMIN
// from the bounding set before exec'ing the agent. Listed first in the
// apt-get install line so the package set is self-documenting at a glance.
//
// xvfb is intentionally NOT in baseline — it's a toggle (`xvfb: true` by

// Renders the shell script that runs as PID 1 inside the container. Two
// modes, picked at boot time from `$TYPECLAW_NETWORK_BLOCK_INTERNAL`:
//
//   off (env unset or != "1"): no rules installed, no setpriv. Just exec
//   `bun run typeclaw "$@"`. Identical observable behavior to a container
//   without this feature. This is the opt-out path for users who set
//   `network.blockInternal: false` in their `typeclaw.json`.
//
//   on (default, env = "1" via `network.blockInternal: true`): walks IPv4 +
//   IPv6 block lists and installs
//   REJECT rules in the OUTPUT chain. Loopback (`-o lo`) is ACCEPT'd first
//   so dev-server dogfooding still works. The hostd HTTP control port on
//   `host.docker.internal` is re-allowed at runtime — narrowly, single
//   TCP destport, only when hostd is configured — so the agent's `restart`
//   tool can still reach the daemon. The shim then drops CAP_NET_ADMIN
//   from the bounding set AND from the inheritable + ambient sets via
//   setpriv before exec'ing the agent. Bounding set is the hard ceiling
//   enforced by execve; inheritable + ambient are cleared defensively to
//   match setpriv(1)'s explicit warning about not dropping the bounding
//   set alone.
//
// Carve-out is intentionally narrow: ACCEPT only `tcp --dport <hostd-port>`
// to the host gateway, never the gateway IP wholesale. Without the dport
// scope, a compromised agent could reach any host service via
// `host.docker.internal:22` (SSH), `:53` (DNS), `:5432` (postgres), etc.
// The gateway IP itself sits inside `172.16.0.0/12`, which the IPv4 reject
// rules below DROP — the narrow ACCEPT here is the only path through.
// When hostd is not configured (`TYPECLAW_HOSTD_URL` unset or unparseable),
// nothing is ACCEPT'd: the agent loses self-restart capability but the
// rest of the egress filter still works.
//
// IPv4-only carve-out uses `getent ahostsv4` to force the resolver into
// the A-record path. Without this, `getent hosts` would return whichever
// family the resolver prefers, and on systems that prefer AAAA we'd feed
// a v6 address to `iptables` and crash under `set -e`. host.docker.internal
// resolves to a bridge gateway that is IPv4-only on every Docker runtime
// we support (Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Docker on Linux with the
// `--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag typeclaw injects).
//
// REJECT (not DROP) so the agent fails fast with an ICMP unreachable
// instead of hanging on a 30-second connect timeout — much friendlier
// debug UX and identical security posture.
//
// `set -eu` propagates rule-install failures up to PID 1 exit, which kills
// the container. Failing closed is the right thing: an unenforced
// blockInternal=true is worse than blockInternal=false.
//
// Carve-out ordering is load-bearing. iptables OUTPUT is first-match-wins,
// and we use -A (append). So the order written into the shim is the order
// rules will be evaluated:
//   1. ESTABLISHED,RELATED ACCEPT (return path for any connection initiated
//      from outside the container — see comment block below)
//   2. loopback ACCEPT
//   3. hostd port ACCEPT (narrow: tcp + single dport on the host gateway)
//   4. resolver ACCEPT (narrow: udp/tcp dport 53 to each /etc/resolv.conf
//      nameserver) — gated on TYPECLAW_NETWORK_AUTO_ALLOW_RESOLVERS=1
//   5. user-supplied allowlist ACCEPT (wholesale: -d <cidr>) — driven by
//      TYPECLAW_NETWORK_ALLOW comma-separated env
//   6. RFC1918 + link-local + CGNAT + multicast + reserved REJECTs
// A resolver at 10.0.0.2 hits (4) and ACCEPTs before (6) DROPs it.
//
// Rule 1 (conntrack ESTABLISHED,RELATED) is what makes Docker port-forward
// reply traffic survive the RFC1918 REJECT. On Docker Desktop and OrbStack
// the bridge gateway is in 192.168.0.0/16 (OrbStack: 192.168.215.1 or
// 192.168.139.1; Docker Desktop: 192.168.65.1). A host -> container request
// via `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:HOST:CONTAINER` arrives at the container
// from the bridge gateway IP. Without rule 1, the reply packets would
// match rule 6 (192.168.0.0/16 REJECT) and never reach the host — TCP
// handshake completes (kernel SYN/ACK is in INPUT, not OUTPUT), the
// request body is delivered, but the agent's HTTP response is dropped at
// OUTPUT. Symptom: `curl http://127.0.0.1:HOST` connects but receives
// zero bytes and times out. Stateful inversion via conntrack is the
// canonical fix: ESTABLISHED matches packets belonging to a connection
// the kernel already tracks (including the inbound port-forward), and
// RELATED covers ICMP error packets for those connections. No new
// outbound capability is granted — a compromised agent still cannot
// initiate connections to RFC1918, only respond to inbound ones.
//
// Requires the `xt_conntrack` kernel module (universal on Linux 2.6.20+
// and on every Docker/OrbStack VM kernel) and the userspace iptables
// `conntrack` match (shipped in the `iptables` Debian package on trixie
// alongside the binary itself; no extra apt install needed).
//
// The resolver carve-out reads /etc/resolv.conf inside the container, NOT
// on the host. Docker propagates the host's resolver into the container by
// default (Docker Desktop and OrbStack rewrite it to the embedded DNS
// proxy at 127.0.0.11; Docker on Linux copies the host's resolv.conf
// verbatim unless --dns is passed). On Docker Desktop / OrbStack the
// nameserver is loopback and the rule is a no-op (loopback is already
// ACCEPT'd by rule 1). On native Linux + EC2/GCE/Azure VMs, the
// nameserver is the VPC resolver inside RFC1918 — exactly the case this
// carve-out targets.
//
// `awk '/^nameserver/{print $2}'` extracts only the IP, skipping
// comments, `search`, `options`, and malformed lines. We don't validate
// the IP further: a malformed nameserver line would have crashed glibc's
// resolver long before the shim ran, so we trust resolv.conf's contents.
// IPv6 nameservers (rare in practice, never the case on EC2/GCE/Azure)
// are skipped by `grep -v ':'` to avoid feeding a v6 address to iptables.
// `iptables -C` (check) is intentionally NOT used to dedupe — duplicate
// ACCEPT rules are harmless (still first-match-wins), and the check
// flag's exit code is hard to reason about under `set -e`.
//
// The user-supplied allowlist (TYPECLAW_NETWORK_ALLOW) is splat on
// commas. Each entry is fed directly to iptables -d, which accepts both
// bare IPs and CIDR notation. Validation already happened in config.ts at
// parse time, so the shim trusts the env. Empty env → loop body never
// runs, zero ACCEPT rules added.

# start_xvfb launches Xvfb in the background under a stripped capability
# bounding set so headed Chrome (agent-browser --headed, Playwright
# headful) has a real X11 display to connect to. Headless containers
# have no display server; Chrome --headless / --headless=new is
# fingerprinted by modern bot detection (Akamai / Cloudflare BM)
# regardless of UA spoof, so real headed Chrome under a virtual
# framebuffer is the only path to a passing sensor score from a
# server-side container.
#
# Two correctness invariants this function enforces:
#
# 1. Xvfb never holds CAP_NET_ADMIN. The shim runs as PID 1 with the
#    container's full capability set (including NET_ADMIN when
#    network.blockInternal=true). If we backgrounded Xvfb naked, it
#    would inherit NET_ADMIN and keep it for the container's lifetime
#    — defeating the capability-drop contract that setpriv applies to
#    the agent process. Routing Xvfb through the same setpriv invocation
#    we use for the agent strips NET_ADMIN before Xvfb's first exec.
#    On the off-path (blockInternal=false) the bounding-set drop is a
#    no-op (NET_ADMIN was never granted), but the call is harmless.
#
# 2. Xvfb startup failure is loud, not silent. \`Xvfb ... >/dev/null &\`
#    under \`set -e\` does not fail the script if Xvfb exits immediately
#    (missing library, port conflict, malformed args). Without the
#    explicit liveness probe below, the shim would then export DISPLAY
#    and exec bun, agent-browser launches would die with "cannot open
#    display", and the operator would chase a phantom bug. We capture
#    $! and \`kill -0\` it on every poll iteration so an early exit
#    becomes a clear stderr line and a non-zero shim exit.
#
# We DO NOT use \`xvfb-run\`. xvfb-run hangs forever when it runs as
# PID 1 inside a container: its SIGUSR1-based ready handshake races
# and stalls because PID 1 ignores signals without explicit handlers,
# so the \`trap : USR1 ; wait || :\` dance never wakes up. Observed in
# practice: container alive, Xvfb running, PID 1 stuck in
# \`rt_sigsuspend\`, no agent process ever spawns, \`docker logs\` empty.
# Documented industry workarounds are tini-as-PID-1 or direct Xvfb
# spawn; we pick the latter (no new dep).
#
# Xvfb args:
#   :99                     fixed display number. Filesystem
#                           (/tmp/.X11-unix/X99) and abstract
#                           (\\0/tmp/.X11-unix/X99) sockets are both
#                           network-namespace-scoped, so :99 is safe

//
// The Anthropic installer drops `claude` at `$HOME/.local/bin/claude` and

// sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/bun-node-fallback-bin`, no
// `~/.local/bin`). Without intervention, every `which claude` from the
// agent (and from the typeclaw-claude-code skill's verification step)
// returns empty. Symlink into `/usr/local/bin/` — already on PATH, matches
// what `cloudflared` does, survives `/root/.local/bin` getting rewritten
// by the installer's "update" path. The symlink resolves to the
// `~/.local/bin/claude` shim, which itself dereferences to the versioned
// binary under `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<ver>/`, so upgrades via
// `claude update` keep working without re-running this layer.
// `~/.claude.json` is Claude Code's internal state file (NOT
// `~/.claude/settings.json`, which is user-facing). On first run with an
// empty or missing file, `claude` enters a TTY-only theme picker:
// "Welcome to Claude Code … Choose the text style that looks best with
// your terminal" with 7 options. The picker is unskippable via CLI
// flags or env vars (no `--skip-onboarding`, no `--theme=dark`;
// `IS_DEMO=1` exists but has documented side effects). The single
// official escape hatch is writing `{"hasCompletedOnboarding": true,
// "theme": "dark"}` to `~/.claude.json` before the first launch —
// confirmed by Anthropic in multiple GitHub issues
// (anthropics/claude-code#4714, #8938, #13827) and the empirical
// answer used by metabase/metabase's `bin/claude-dangerous`, the
// `claudeCodeAlDevContainer` feature, and dozens of other Docker
// integrations.
//
// Without the pre-seed, the very first agent-driven `tmux new-session …
// claude` invocation hangs on the theme picker: the agent's
// `send-keys "<prompt>" Enter` arrives at the picker, gets interpreted
// as picker input, and never reaches claude's actual prompt. The
// `typeclaw-claude-code` skill is structured around a `Stop`-hook
// sentinel, which never fires while the picker is up, so the polling
// loop only learns of the hang at the 10-minute wall-clock budget.
// Pre-seeding here costs ~85 bytes on disk and zero runtime overhead.
//
// SCOPE: this seed is NECESSARY but not SUFFICIENT for a fully
// no-questions-asked first launch. Claude Code also shows two
// post-seed modal dialogs that this file deliberately does NOT
// pre-clear:
//   1. "Detected a custom API key from environment. Do you want to use
//      this API key?" — fires when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set. Options
//      `[No (recommended), Yes]`, focus on No, picker does NOT wrap.
//   2. Workspace trust ("Do you trust the files in this folder?") —
//      fires on every new cwd. Options `[Yes, proceed, No, exit]`,
//      focus on Yes.
// Both are kept as runtime decisions handled by the
// `typeclaw-claude-code` skill (see its "Driving the session" section,
// "Clear startup dialogs" step, which uses dialog-specific keystrokes
// because the picker doesn't wrap). Pre-seeding
// `hasTrustDialogAccepted` or `customApiKeyResponses.approved` here
// would silently widen the trust surface in ways the operator hasn't
// consented to — the seed's job is strictly cosmetic-wizard removal,
// not trust/permission preemption.
//
// `theme: "dark"` matches typeclaw's default TUI theme so the visual
// transition between the typeclaw TUI and a tmux-attached claude pane
// is consistent. Users on light terminals can override by editing
// `~/.claude.json` (which persists across container restarts only if
// they mount it; in the default container-ephemeral state it resets
// to this default on every rebuild, which is fine — `claude` reads
// the file at startup and the theme has no behavioral impact).
//
// `lastOnboardingVersion` is INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. ii-agent and a
// few other templates ship `lastOnboardingVersion: "1.0.30"`, but
// that value is version-coupled and goes stale on every Claude Code
// release. Empirically against Claude Code 2.1.146, the current
// `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` alone is honored without a version
// pin. If a future Claude version starts re-triggering the picker
// when the field is missing, capture `claude --version` output at
// build time and inject it then — don't hardcode a stale value.
//
// `installMethod: "native"` and `numStartups: 1` match the shape
// Claude Code itself writes after a clean first launch; keeping them
// makes our seed indistinguishable from a real post-onboarding state,
// which minimizes the chance of a future "if the file looks like
// agent-pre-seed, redo onboarding" detection heuristic landing on us.
//
// Built via `JSON.stringify` rather than a hand-written string
// literal so quote/escape bugs surface as TS errors at compile time,
// not as a corrupt `~/.claude.json` discovered only when the build
// runs. The `printf '%s\\n' '<JSON>'` shell pattern relies on the
// JSON containing no single quotes (true by construction — JSON.
// stringify only emits double quotes); a regression test parses the

// regardless of the requested mode. Three upstream fix PRs (#660, #370,
// #387) have been open and unmerged for months as of 2026-05, so we
// patch this locally rather than block on upstream.
//
// Allowlist, not denylist. The wrapper only pre-closes on the three
// commands that explicitly start a new browsing session (\`open\`,
// \`goto\`, \`navigate\`). Every other agent-browser subcommand — \`click\`,
// \`snapshot\`, \`chat\`, \`connect\`, \`batch\`, \`tab\`, \`record\`, \`trace\`,
// \`stream\`, \`cookies\`, \`network\`, ... — passes through untouched.
// Rationale: those subcommands may operate on the live browser/page
// state (cookies, in-progress recording, attached external CDP, etc.),
// and a pre-close from us would silently destroy it. The user-reported
// scenario for #1083 (\"\`agent-browser open <url> --headed\` after a
// previous headless invocation\") is fully covered because the
// follow-up commands inherit the now-headed browser the \`open\`
// pre-close forced. An earlier draft used a deny-list approach that
// pre-closed on every non-skip subcommand under headed env; oracle
// self-review flagged the state-destruction risk for stateful commands,
// and the allowlist fix is the resulting narrower contract.
//
// Truthy contract mirrors upstream's \`env_var_is_truthy\`
// (cli/src/flags.rs:183): any non-empty value EXCEPT case-insensitive
// "0" / "false" / "no" counts as truthy. So
// \`AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED=yes\`, \`=y\`, \`=on\`, \`=anything-non-falsy\` all
// trigger the workaround — matching what upstream's CLI parser would
// see — instead of the original narrower 1|true match that left the
// bug present for legitimate truthy values.
//
// Re-entrancy is defended at two layers. (1) The pre-close path is
// \`open\`/\`goto\`/\`navigate\` only, and the close subcommand isn't in the
// allowlist, so the pre-close never recurses through the wrapper into
// another pre-close. (2) \`_TYPECLAW_AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED_HANDLED=1\` is
// set on the env passed to both the pre-close and the final exec; if a
// future subcommand we don't recognize shells out to \`agent-browser\` as
// a subprocess while headed env is still set, the child sees the guard
// and bypasses straight to .real without recursing.
