  // user can address two bots by name in one message ("Toto, Lala, both
  // take a look") and both should engage. Each bot only knows its own
  // aliases, so cross-bot suppression isn't possible at this layer
  // anyway — the router-side peer-name suppression in the solo-human
  // fallback handles that case (follow-up).

  // Solo-human fallback: the strict mention/reply/dm gate keeps the bot
  // quiet in multi-human conversations, but in a 1-human channel that
  // same gate makes the agent silent on messages plainly meant for it.
  // The fallback engages on any human inbound when the channel has at
  // most one human participant, and reverts to strict the moment a second
  // human posts. Peer bots are tracked as participants for context but
  // excluded from the count here, so a 1-human channel stays "solo" even
  // when several bots also speak in it.
  //
  // Two suppressors override the fallback when the message is clearly
  // addressed to someone else:
  //   1. `mentionsOthers` — the message tags at least one other user and
  //      none of the mentions resolve to us.
  //   2. `replyToOtherMessageId` — the message is a reply, but the parent
  //      was authored by someone other than us (Discord's threaded reply
  //      arrow is the canonical case).
  // Both are populated by the adapter classifiers; either one flips the
  // fallback off for that single message without changing channel state.
  // Explicit triggers (DM, mention-of-us, reply-to-us, sticky) above are
  // unaffected — those still engage even when the message also tags a
  // third party.
  //
  // PEER BOTS NEVER QUALIFY for this fallback. It is a courtesy to humans
  // who don't want to type `@bot` in their own DM-like channel; peer bots
  // have no such ergonomic excuse. Letting peer bots ride the fallback
  // produced bot-to-bot conversations in 1-human-N-bot channels (observed:
  // Momo and Kiki introducing themselves to each other after a single
  // "hey folks" from the human, then continuing to address each other for
  // ~6 turns). The router's loop guard only trips after 5 consecutive
  // peer engagements, which is too late to prevent the embarrassment.
  //
  // PHILOSOPHY (do not relitigate): peer bots remain reachable through
  // the SAME triggers as humans (mention/reply/dm/sticky); we do NOT
  // downgrade them to "mention-only". Bot-to-bot conversation is a
  // legitimate first-class use case in this codebase. The fix is to
  // close the unintended fallback, not to firewall bots behind explicit
  // mentions. A future maintainer (human or AI) tempted to add a
  // `peerBotTriggers: 'mention-only'` config — or any equivalent gate
  // that demands explicit `@bot` from peer bots — should not. The user
  // has rejected that design repeatedly. The right knob is `trigger`
  // (which already applies symmetrically to humans and bots) plus this
